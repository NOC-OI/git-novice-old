title: Conflicts
teaching: 15
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else's?"
objectives:
- "Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur."
- "Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge."
- "Understand how to create a pull request."
keypoints:
- "Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same lines of the same file."
- "The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved."
- "Pull requests are a better way to manage several people working on the same files at the same time."
---

As soon as people can work in parallel, they'll likely step on each other's
toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts]({{ page.root}}{% link reference.md %}#conflict) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#resolve) overlapping changes.

We already created a merge conflict during the exercise in the last section. Just in case we want to create another we can do the following.

~~~
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
name,symbol,creator,comments,lon,lat
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts,-4.08225,52.415250
~~~
{: .output}

Let's add a line to the collaborator's copy only:

~~~
$ nano places.csv
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
name,symbol,creator,comments,lon,lat
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts and burgers,-4.08225,52.415250
~~~
{: .output}

and then push the change to GitHub:

~~~
$ git add places.csv
$ git commit -m "Add a mention of burgers"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[main 5ae9631] Add a mention of burgers
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git push origin main
~~~

Now let's have the owner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

~~~
$ nano places.csv
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
name,symbol,creator,comments,lon,lat
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts and milkshakes,-4.08225,52.415250
~~~
{: .output}

We can commit the change locally:

~~~
$ git add places.csv
$ git commit -m "Mention how good the milkshakes are"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[main 07ebc69] Mention how good the milkshakes are
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
To git@github.com:NOC-OI/favourite-places.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git rejects the push because it detects that the remote repository has new updates that have not been
incorporated into the local branch.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in, and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~
$ git pull origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 3 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From git@github.com:NOC-OI/favourite-places.git
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
    29aba7c..dabb4c8  main     -> origin/main
Auto-merging places.csv
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in places.csv
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
~~~
{: .output}

The `git pull` command updates the local repository to include those
changes already included in the remote repository.
After the changes from remote branch have been fetched, Git detects that changes made to the local copy 
overlap with those made to the remote repository, and therefore refuses to merge the two versions to
stop us from trampling on our previous work. The conflict is marked in
in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
<<<<<<< HEAD
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts and milkshakes,-4.08225,52.415250
=======
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts and burgers,-4.08225,52.415250
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
~~~
{: .output}

Our change is preceded by `<<<<<<< HEAD`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

~~~
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts, milkshakes and burgers,-4.08225,52.415250
~~~
{: .output}

To finish merging,
we add `places.csv` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add places.csv
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

	modified:   places.csv

~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git commit -m "Merge changes from GitHub"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[main 2abf2b1] Merge changes from GitHub
~~~
{: .output}

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

~~~
$ git pull origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

Fast-forward
 places.csv | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~~~

We get the merged file:

~~~
$ cat places.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Sophie's,cafe,Colin Sauze,good cooked breakfasts, milkshakes and burgers,-4.08225,52.415250
~~~
{: .output}

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Git's ability to resolve conflicts is very useful, but conflict resolution
costs time and effort, and can introduce errors if conflicts are not resolved
correctly. If you find yourself resolving a lot of conflicts in a project,
consider these technical approaches to reducing them:

- Pull from upstream more frequently, especially before starting new work
- Use topic branches to segregate work, merging to main when complete
- Make smaller more atomic commits
- Where logically appropriate, break large files into smaller ones so that it is
  less likely that two authors will alter the same file simultaneously

Conflicts can also be minimized with project management strategies:

- Clarify who is responsible for what areas with your collaborators
- Discuss what order tasks should be carried out in with your collaborators so
  that tasks expected to change the same lines won't be worked on simultaneously
- If the conflicts are stylistic churn (e.g. tabs vs. spaces), establish a
  project convention that is governing and use code style tools (e.g.
  `htmltidy`, `perltidy`, `rubocop`, etc.) to enforce, if necessary

> ## Solving Conflicts that You Created
>
> In the group exercise in the last section you probably created a merge conflict.
> If you didn't, make another change to your copy of places.csv to cause one. 
> Rembmer to add, commit and push the change, the push stage should give a merge error. 
> Now attempt to resolve the conflict, you might have to do this multiple times to deal with everyone's changes.
> Ask the instructor and helper(s) to help resolve this. It can help if each person takes it in turn to resolve the conflict.

## Pull Requests

As you have seen, multiple people working on the same repository can cause a lot of problems. Github provides another way to collaborate called pull requests. In these each person makes their own copy of the repository on Github, this is known as a fork. Instead of working in the same repository as everyone else, each person works on their own fork. When they are ready to send the changes back to the main repository they create a pull request (literally asking the owner of the repository to do a git pull from theirs). Github wraps this in a nice interface, which allows you to write a comment about what you changed, for the owner to review your changes (and possibly request you make more before they accept it) and for them to finally accept or reject them. Once they are accepted the changes from your fork are merged into the upstream repository. If there are any conflicts then it will be up to the owner of the upstream repository to resolve them.

> ## Pull Requesting Changes
> * Create a fork of the favourite-places repository by visiting https://github.com/NOC-OI/favourite-places and clicking on the fork link near the top right hand corner.
> * Create an additional change to the places.csv file in the repository.
> * Github should now tell you that your fork is "1 commit ahead" of the upstream repository and offer a "Contribute" button to start the pull request.
> * Click this and choose "Open Pull Request".
> * The next screen will highlight the differences between your version and the upstream one. Go ahead and click "Create pull request".
> * The repository owner should now get an alert about your pull request and can choose whether to merge it or not.
>
> When do you think it is best to use pull requests and when is it best to allow multiple people to write to the same repository?
{: .challenge}

> ## Making additional changes to a Pull Request
> * Create another pull request using the same method as above.
> * After submitting the pull request, you decide to make another change either because you found a mistake or the upstream repository owner asked you to fix something.
> * Make this change to your fork and push them to github.
> * What happens to the pull request?
> 
> > ## Solution
> > The pull request should automatically update with any additional changes you make.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Pull Requests in Big Projects
> In many large projects all work will be done via pull requests and merging changes back into the main repository will involve a large scale code review process. There may also be autoamted checks involved to stop code which doesn't pass tests (or doesn't have tests) from being merged into a production system.
